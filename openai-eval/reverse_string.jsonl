We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides—the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue format. To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which consisted of two or more model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these reward models, we can fine-tune the model using Proximal Policy Optimization. We performed several iterations of this process."}], "ideal": ".ssecorp siht fo snoitareti lareves demrofrep eW .noitazimitpO yciloP lamixorP gnisu ledom eht enut-enif nac ew ,sledom drawer eseht gnisU .meht knar sreniart IA dah dna ,snoitelpmoc evitanretla lareves delpmas ,egassem nettirw-ledom a detceles ylmodnar eW .tobtahc eht htiw dah sreniart IA taht snoitasrevnoc koot ew ,atad siht tcelloc oT .ytilauq yb deknar sesnopser ledom erom ro owt fo detsisnoc hcihw ,atad nosirapmoc tcelloc ot dedeen ew ,gninrael tnemecrofnier rof ledom drawer a etaerc oT .tamrof eugolaid a otni demrofsnart ew hcihw ,tesatad TPGtcurtsnI eht htiw tesatad eugolaid wen siht dexim eW .sesnopser rieht esopmoc meht pleh ot snoitseggus nettirw-ledom ot ssecca sreniart eht evag eW .tnatsissa IA na dna resu eht—sedis htob deyalp yeht hcihw ni snoitasrevnoc dedivorp sreniart IA namuh :gninut-enif desivrepus gnisu ledom laitini na deniart eW .putes noitcelloc atad eht ni secnereffid thgils htiw tub ,TPGtcurtsnI sa sdohtem emas eht gnisu ,)FHLR( kcabdeeF namuH morf gninraeL tnemecrofnieR gnisu ledom siht deniart eW"}
